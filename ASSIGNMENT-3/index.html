                        <p>The perfect balance of chocolate and wafer, there's a reason KitKat is enjoyed in more than
                            80
                            countries. The iconic brand is an international symbol for hitting the pause button on life
                            - to
                            enjoy a well-earned break.

                            From classic fingers to chunky, original to peanut butter, there is a KitKat for everyone.

                            In Japan alone, flavors include wasabi and sake - while the gift of a KitKat is customary
                            for
                            students sitting their exams. The country's KitKat Chocolatory even lets you design your own
                            dream
                            KitKat.

                            KitKat is the first global chocolate brand to use 100% sustainably sourced cocoa through the
                            Nestlé
                            Cocoa Plan and Rainforest Alliance certified. Meaning there's no reason not to pause… and
                            enjoy
                            a
                            break.</p>

                        <p>The KIT KAT Bar got its start across the pond in 1935. Originally known by Londoners as
                            “Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp,” the candy was renamed in 1937 to “Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp.”
                            While KIT KAT Bars are a global confection, The Hershey Company has produced the candy in
                            the U.S. since 1970.</p>

                <p>Good food nourishes and delights the senses. It helps pets to thrive, children to grow healthily and
                    parents to age gracefully. It helps all of us to live life to the fullest. Good food also respects
                    our planet and protects resources for future generations. But times are changing fast. And we know
                    that whats good today wont be good enough tomorrow. Consider the challenge of satisfying the needs
                    of 10 billion people by 2050 in a responsible and sustainable way. This will demand innovation and
                    change. At Nestlé, we are constantly pushing the boundaries of whats possible with food, drink and
                    nutritional health solutions. That way we can enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier
                    future for all. Today, our business has around 275,000 employees, more than 2,000 brands and a
                    presence in 188 countries.</p>
